• Digital  games  have   become  a  ubiquitous  part   of  our  society.    Developing   games   bring   our   vision   to   life   with   the   latest technological   innovations  and   convenient tools .

• Today’s   most  played  games  are  shooting   games   like  Player Unknown's BattleGrounds  (PUBG) ,  Garena  free fire ,  call  of  duty  and  so  on  which are  all  violent  games  affecting  the mentality  of   users   including   small    kids 

• The main objective of our project is to develop a simple shooting game  which can be used by kids for having fun instead of violence .

• It is a real world video game of Python made with the help of PyGame module.Suitable background , graphics and sound effects will  be included for attracting kids .

• At the end of the project , We can have a clear view on how to import required modules and resources for graphics and sound effects , performing actions like movement and rotation .

The Title of our Game is Pikachu PaRa . It is a one player game . Player gets portrayed as Pikachu which has to protect his friends namely pokemon , may , misty and brock from antagonist group 

So the main concept is Pikachu has to shoot the antagonist members before they reach Pikachu's friends .

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY

The game starts with a welcome screen which has 2 options namely quit and start . If the player press quit , the window gets closed . If the player press start , then the game starts with an amazing sound effects .
 
On the left side of the screen , The player can see the four friends of pikachu infreeze mode . And Pikachu right before them with a shooting  
Guns.


From the right side , the antagonist members will keep on coming to get near the friends of pikachu . Pikachu needs to shoot those antagonist members before they could reach his friends .

If pikachu fails to do so , the life span (green) in health bar located at the top left corner gets decreased and shows red colour. Within a particular time (game time) , if the health bar becomes fully red then the screen displays 'YOU FAIL' with relevant sound effect and screen display .

If the health bar is good , but the game time ends then the screen displays 'YOU WIN' with 'accuracy' of the player  and relevant sound effects and screen display .

LIST OF MODULES 

• Pygame.
• Math.
• Random.
• Sys.

Pygame module
The Pygame Library Is An Open-source Module For The Python Programming Language Specifically Intended To Help You Make Games And Other Multimedia Applications. Pygame Can Run Across Many Platforms AndOperating Systems.

Math module
Math Module Is Defined As The Most Famous Mathematical Functions, Which Includes Trigonometric Functions, Representation Functions, Logarithmic Functions, Etc. Furthermore, It Also Defines Two Mathematical Constants, I.E., Pie And Euler Number, Etc.

Random module
Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers.

Sys module
The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. 

CONCLUSION : 


Thus , a shooting video game with pikachu as the lead is developed for kidsto play . To be more realistic , background and sound effects are added .Data handling comes into play when the user wins , to display best accuracy.And that’s how , user (kids) will be playing continuously to beat their own best !!!
